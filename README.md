# Prediction of Diabetes based on Multiple Diagnostic and Lifestyle Features

Diabetes mellitus, also commonly known as diabetes is a disorder that is characterized by high
blood sugar. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effec-
tively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy.
There are three different types of diabetes, namely:
• Type I: Type I diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction. This reaction stops your body
from making insulin.
• Type II: Insulin release may be at normal levels in type 2 diabetes. However, an imbalance
in blood sugar and insulin creates resistance to the hormone insulin.
• Gestational: It is diagnosed for the first time during the pregnancy. It causes high blood
sugar that can affect your pregnancy and the baby’s health.
Diabetes can cause a number of significant, long-term, complicated diseases including blood vessel
and nerve damage, peripheral artery disease, kidney failure, etc. The World Health Organisation
estimated that diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million fatalities in 2019, with nearly half of those
deaths occurring in persons under the age of 70.
This statistic is estimated to reach 650 million by 2040. Early detection, diagnosis and prediction
of diabetic patients can significantly reduce the risk of complications and improve the quality of life.
Therefore, the motivation of this study is to use machine learning models in order to predict diabetes
given a dataset.
In this project we use several machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Multiclass Logistic
Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors methods on a survey response to the CDC’s BRFSS2015 data
set. In this simple classification problem, we chose to use these three methods in particular based on
the literature review.
